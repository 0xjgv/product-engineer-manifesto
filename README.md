# Product Engineer Manifesto

We are *Builders* first, *Software Engineers* second.

Our craft combines product thinking with technical execution.

We concern ourselves with matters of quality and design in the technical,
aesthetic, and business domains.

We take professional pride in the products we build as a whole and refuse to
limit ourselves to technical-only roles in our teams.

In our work as *Product Engineers*, we have come to value:

- **Continuous delivery of working software** over promises and estimations
- **Customer collaboration and feedback** over tickets and second-hand knowledge
- **Teamwork and communication** over working in isolation
- **Simplicity and quality** over cutting corners or over-engineering
