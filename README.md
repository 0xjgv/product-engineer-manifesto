<h1>Product Engineer Manifesto</h1>
</div>

We consider ourselves *Builders* first, Software Engineers second.

Our craft combines *Product Thinking* with technical execution.

We concern ourselves with matters of design and quality in the technical,
aesthetic, and business domains, taking an active part in each to shape the
product.

We take immense professional pride in our products as a whole and refuse to
limit ourselves to taking a technical-only role in our teams.

## The Product Engineer Mindset

In our work as *Product Engineers*, we have come to value:

- **Asking why** to understand the customer problem before diving into code
- **Continuous delivery of working software** over promises and estimations
- **Customer collaboration and feedback** over tickets and second-hand knowledge
- **Teamwork and communication** over assigning tasks and working in isolation
